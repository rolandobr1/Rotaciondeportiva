# **App Name**: Court Commander

## Core Features:

- Waiting List Management: Manage the waiting list: adding and removing players from the waiting list to control who is available to play.
- Automatic Team Balancing Tool: Automatic team formation: Automatically create balanced teams from the waiting list based on win rate (using the win-rate values to feed the large language model).
- Manual Team Assignment with AI balancing: Manual assignment override: Allows the user to manually assign players to teams, overriding the automatic assignment. Use generative AI to provide recommendations if manual assignment causes imbalances between teams. The generated content will only be a suggestion, never executed without explicit consent.
- Match Result Recording: Record match outcomes: Register which team won a match, which updates player statistics such as win rates.
- Champion Rule Management: Handle champion rule: Option to activate a rule where a team that wins a certain number of games in a row becomes the 'champion' and gets to rest, changing game dynamics.
- Responsive UI: Responsive Design: The app should adapt to different screen sizes and devices for use on tablets and mobile.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#3F704D) to convey growth, teamwork and a natural, welcoming feel.
- Background color: Soft, desaturated beige (#F5F5DC), a natural and calming backdrop, providing good contrast to the forest green.
- Accent color: Burnt orange (#CC6633) for interactive elements, creating a focus and call to action. This brings the analogous hues together in one design.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif. Headline font: 'Playfair', serif. For clear UI readability combined with a touch of elegant styling.
- Use flat style icons to represent in-app actions and elements for a modern and clean feel. Icons related to basketball or teamwork where appropriate.
- Clean and structured layout using a grid system to align UI components.
- Subtle transitions when adding players, switching teams, or updating statistics for a smooth user experience.
